=================

About
---
This repository holds headers from the Microsoft DirectX SDK (August 2009) which can be downloaded [from MSDN here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=23549) for use with [NateCommander](https://github.com/nathan-schubkegel/NateCommander). (The full DirectX SDK is not used in order to allow developers to avoid installing the DirectX SDK to build NateCommander.)

The 'master' branch contains the latest utilized release of the headers. The 'NateCommander' branch contains modifications required to build with NateCommander.
